Developed Speed LK, a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with a MySQL database hosted on Clever Cloud. The application focuses on RESTful APIs, implementing GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, and PUT requests for efficient data management. It features JWT-based user authentication, structured entities including Item, Location, and User, and supports CRUD operations for Items and CRU for Users. Users can search for items by location, and images uploaded for items are stored in Firebase for seamless media management. Additionally, the application integrates a free currency exchange API to provide real-time currency conversions, enhancing the platformâ€™s usability. This project highlights expertise in full-stack development, API integration, cloud-based database management, and secure authentication mechanisms.
